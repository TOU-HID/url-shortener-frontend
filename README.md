# URL Shortener Frontend

This is the frontend application for the URL Shortener project, built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It provides a modern user interface for shortening URLs, managing user authentication, and viewing list of urls.

## 1. Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1.1 Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 20.19.0)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Usually comes with node.js)
- [Backend server running](https://github.com/TOU-HID/url-shortener-backend.git)

### 1.2 Getting Started

- **Clone the repository:**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/TOU-HID/url-shortener-frontend.git
  ```

- Navigate to the frontend directory:

  ```bash
  cd url-shortener-frontend
  ```

- Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Create a `.env` file in the root of the `frontend` directory:

  ```bash
  touch .env
  ```

  Add the following environment variable (match this with your backend URL):

  ```env
  VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
  ```

- Run the frontend server:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 3. Design Decisions

- **Redux Toolkit**: Chosen for global state management to handle complex states like user authentication status and the list of URLs. It simplifies asynchronous logic (via `createAsyncThunk`) and ensures predictable state updates.
- **Axios Interceptors**: Implemented to automatically attach the JWT token to every request and globally handle `401 Unauthorized` errors by redirecting the user to login. This keeps components clean of authentication logic.
- **Modular Architecture**: Components are strictly organized by feature (Auth, Dashboard, UrlShortener) rather than type. This improves maintainability and scalability.
- **TypeScript**: Used extensively to ensure type safety for API responses, Redux state, and Component props, reducing runtime errors.

## 4. Known Limitations

- **Pagination**: The dashboard currently loads a list of URLs (defaulting to the backend limit, likely 100). Full pagination controls (Next/Prev pages) are not yet implemented in the UI.
- **Persistence**: Authentication state is persisted in `localStorage`. While standard for many applications, more sensitive applications might prefer HTTP-only cookies.
- **Data Validation**: Frontend relies on HTML5 validation and basic types. Comprehensive schema validation (e.g., Zod, Yap) could be added for more robust form handling.
